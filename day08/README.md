# Day 08 - Piscine_Php

### Awesome Starships Battles I

This day we covered the utilisation of traits (inheritance but in an horizontal point of view), final classes, exceptions (handling errors), reflection classes and reflection objects (recover and manipulate the data inside). The exercise goal was to create a game called "Awesome Starships Battles", a 2 players game which goal is to control a fleet of spaceships and eliminate the adversary fleet first. The composition of this game was very convenient to put togheter PHP-OOP, HTML and CSS.
