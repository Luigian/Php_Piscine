<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles 3D vectors.

An instance can be constructed from two distinct vertex, each one with 
x, y, z, w.
new Vector( array( "dest" => instance, "orig" => instance) );

"dest": the vector’s destination vertex, mandatory.
"orig": the vector’s origin vertex, optional, by default is worth a new
 instance of the x=0, y=0, z=0, w=1 vertex.

Once a vector is instantiated, its status is final. No setters.

The attributes are private. You can access them with the accessor get:
getX();

The class provides the following methods:

- magnitude() : returns the length (norme) of the instanced Vector.

- normalize() : returns a normalized version of the Vector. If the vector is
already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.

- add( Vector $v ) : returns the sum vector of both vectors.

- sub( Vector $v ) : returns the difference vector of both vectors.

- opposite() : returns the opposite vector.

- scalarProduct( $k ) : returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.

- dotProduct( Vector $v ) : returns the angle’sAppendix cosine between 
both vectors.

- crossProduct( Vector $rhs ) : returns the cross multiplication of 
both vectors (right-hand mark).
