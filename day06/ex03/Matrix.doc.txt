<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class handles 4x4 matrixes.

The class contains seven constants: 

IDENTITY: gives identity to a matrix.
SCALE: gives the scale to a matrix.
RX: rotate a matrix in the x axis.
RY: rotate a matrix in the y axis.
RZ: rotate a matrix in the y axis.
TRANSLATION: move or translate a matrix.
PROJECTION: change the type of projection to a matrix.  

Once a matrix is instantiated, its status is final. No setters.

The attributes are private. You can access them with the accessor get:
getX();

The class provides the following methods to multiply two matrices and 
multiply a matrix and a vertex:

- mult() : returns the multiplication of both matrices.

- transformVertex() : returns a new vertex resulting from
the transformation of the vertex by the matrix.
