# Piscine_Php - 42 School Two-Weeks Web Boot Camp 

## Highlights

* This project is about re-building the printf function with most of its functionality by using only other self-built functions based on the C standard library.

* ft_printf writes output to stdout according to a format and returns the number of characters printed or a negative number in case of error.  

* ft_printf is prototyped similarly to printf: `int ft_printf(const char* format, ...)`

* ft_printf is a variadic function wich means that it can print a varying number of arguments of varying types.

* The string `const char* format` is composed by ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output; and conversion specifications introduced by `%` and ended by the type of conversion which must correspond properly to the next argument in the argument list `...`. The following may appear in a conversion sequence: 

  `%[argument][flag][width][precision][length]type`
  
* ft_printf is a great opportunity to implement a basic 'dispatcher' in C via the use of an array of function’s pointers.

## Summary of the Piscine

### Day 00 - HTML and CSS
This day was about learning how to create elements in HTML and give style with CSS to fictional web pages with re-directional links, tables, images, shrink responsiveness and drop down menus.    
### Day 01 - PHP
From writing the classic "hello world", in this day we started to getting familiar with the PHP syntax by coding some programs to manipulate integers and strings. 
### Day 02 - PHP
A funny mystery story led us through various exercises to discover a little bit more about php's libraries and helpfull functions to access local and external data.

### Day 03 - PHP - MAMP
After installing our web server with the 42 PAMP tool (or localhost) we wrote php codes capable of recovering users and passwords, saving and deleting cookies, displaying images in the browser window and validating member access to fictional web pages.

### Day 04 - PHP - MAMP
In this day we created different pages to manage a user session. The exercises were about creating an account, login (authorization via a self-build function), changing the password and be able to save in a file certain data to create a basic multi-user chat page.

### Day 05 - SQL


### Day 06 - PHP - OOP
### Day 07 - PHP - OOP
### Day 08 - Awesome Starships Battles I
### Day 09 - JavaScript and JQuery
### Rush 00 - E-commerce
After the first week of the piscine, we had to -in a weekend– create a mini e-commerce online shop. This should cover products and users management with a well organized data base. Our e-commerce should allow a user to register, connect, add articles in his basket and validate his order. Once validated, the order must be visible from an administration section.

### Rush 01 - Awesome Starships Battles II

## Process Logbook

As they say: "The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and good extensible code", so i try to give me the time to understand how the true printf worked to be prepared for the battle and this is the summary of what I did:

* Read the pdf.
* Read about variadic functions on internet.
* Read the man: `man 3 stdarg` `man printf` `man 3 printf`.
* Learn about format conversion specifications for printf.
* Learn more about data types.
* Learn about integers lengths: `char`, `short`, `long`, `long long`, `nan`.
* Learn about floats: single precision, double precision and extended precision. 
* I made the next table to visualize the last two points:

* I made the following table to help me see, by testing the real printf, how the different types worked with the different combinations of format specifications.

* An extension of the previous table with a more concise display was very practical while coding.

After this, i started to write the code in the following order:

* Storing the format specifications (flags, width, precision, length) in variables of a structure.
* The functions to print d, i and u.
* Then the functions to print o, x, X and p.
* Then the functions to print c, s.
* The most difficult one for me, the function to print f.
* Then i worked on big numbers (negatives and positives), zero and null cases.
* After that, i started with bonuses: \*, j, z, U, e, g, $, ', b and k.

## Installation
`make && make clean` | Compiles and creates the library `libftprintf.a`.

`make re && make clean` | Recompiles.

## Usage
`gcc resources/test_main.c libftprintf.a && ./a.out` | Prints the test main provided as example.
